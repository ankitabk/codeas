    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The origin of noodles is Chinese.The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220). Noodles, often made from wheat dough, had become a staple food for the people of the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).

A Nature article claimed the oldest evidence of noodle consumption was from 4,000 years ago in China. In 2005, a team of archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained 4000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site. These noodle were said to resemble lamian, which are a type of Chinese noodle that is made by repeatedly pulling and stretching the dough by hand. Analyzing the husk phytoliths and starch grains present in the sediment associated with the noodles, it was determined that the noodles were made from millet, identified as belonging to Panicum miliaceum and Setaria italica specifically.

      <h2>
        Preparation
      </h2>
      <p>
        Vegetable noodles is a very popular Indo Chinese dish. I don't think there will be anyone who does not like noodles.It is so easy to prepare and also tastes good. I have added lot of vegetables to make it more healthy. You can even use whole wheat noodles to make it even more healthier. Today we will learn how to make Mixed Vegetable Noodles following this simple recipe.
      Bring water to boil adding a tsp of oil and 1/2 tsp of salt.Then add noodles to the boiling water. Stir it now and then to prevent the noodles from sticking together. Do not over cook the noodles. It should be cooked al dente. Test it by tasting the noodles. It should be firm but not hard.

Drain the noodles in a colander and run cold water over it to prevent it from sticking to each other.

Cut the vegetables (carrot, onions, cabbage and capsicum) into thin strips as shown below and keep it aside. This is a very important step.
